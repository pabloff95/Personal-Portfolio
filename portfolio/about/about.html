                        I grew up in the north of Spain, in Santander. But I have had the opportunity to live in various locations such as Barcelona (Spain), Gerona (Spain), 
                        Looe (UK), Ghent (Belgium) and Salem (Germany). Now, I am based in Neuburg an der Donau (Germany). Each of these places has allowed me to learn from diverse
                         cultures and meet incredible people. Because of it I can speak

                        During my undergraduate studies, I commuted daily approximately four hours between Barcelona and Gerona, but I used this time for studying and for working in 
                        my projects. This determination, combined with my curiosity, has brought me to learn from a variety of subjects including software development, data analysis, economics, 
                        ecology, and genetics. I am always eager to continue learning and improving.<br><br>

                        In addition to my studies, I am also passionate about new experiences and challenges. This led me to participate in an Erasmus volunteer project,where I lived in 
                        a caravan for a year in the UK. I believe volunteering is an excellent way to grow as an individual and make a positive impact in the world.<br><br>                    

                        In my free time I enjoy staying active through sports, coding personal projects, spending time with friends and family, reading and cooking.

                    I specialize in web application development, with a focus on frontend development. However, my ultimate goal is to become a fullstack developer.<br><br>

                    I initially discovered my passion for programming while pursuing a master's degree in biology in 2019. I enjoyed it so much that I decided to undertake a 
                    two-year degree in web application development. Alongside my formal education, I have also enhanced my skills through online resources and personal 
                    projects, which can be found on this website.<br><br>

                    With my background in programming, web development, data analysis, data management, science, and research, I have a diverse set of skills 
                    that I bring to every project I work on. As a web developer, I have had the opportunity to acquire a diverse set of technical skills, including great 
                    experience in various programming languages, familiarity with database management systems, and the ability to write clean, reusable and well-documented code. 
                    Additionally, I have experience with responsive design and the ability to troubleshoot and debug code.<br><br>

                    Here, you can have a look to the technologies I use to develope my projects: <br><br>
